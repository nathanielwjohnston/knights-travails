# knights-travails

Project designed to simulate a knight moving from one position on a chessbaord
to another as specified on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails).

[knightUpgrade](knightUpgrade.mjs) was my second attempt to make my code more
concise by not having to rely on an explicit structure like in [chessboard](chessboard.mjs).
